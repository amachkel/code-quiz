## Coding Quiz

```
A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores your
remaining time as your score. On a separate HTML and JS file, the 
high scores page pulls from local storage and displays
a list. The user can then clear the high scores and go back to the quiz.
This project utilizes Bootstrap for styling.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
