## Coding Quiz

```
A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores your
remaining time as your score. On a separate HTML and JS file, the 
high scores page pulls from local storage and displays
a list. The user can then clear the high scores and go back to the quiz.
This project utilizes Bootstrap for styling.
